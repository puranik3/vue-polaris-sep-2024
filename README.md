## Vue course
[Vue videos playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCk2SWeTHqQjbME3mOg8fOFjHgmj8rsXt)

## Videos
- The reason why tests were not running fine was the npm installations of the testing related packages was made from the top-level folder, rather than the project folder (you can see that there is a package.json in the top-level folder). I will upload the videos on Unit Testing (remaining tests) and Authentication utilizing Pinia store soon.

## Exercise
- Filter in the app (Workshops list)
- Class styling for subscription buttons (Free/Premium/Pro)
- Define a star rating component - shows 5 stars, takes rating value as input (1 - 5). It displays the rating (with empty, half star, fully filled solid star/moon) - Additionally you can implement click on star to change rating value.
- Validation logic for previous / next buttons (disabling buttons)
- Any lab guide questions (Vue / React lab guides)
